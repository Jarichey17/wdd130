    <p>I am an accounting major and hope to graduate in December. My wife and
        I have been married just over 2 years now and absolutely love the life
        we are creating for ourselves. I grew up in Washington, my wife Arizona,
        and we hope to end up in North Carolina where I already have a job lined up.
